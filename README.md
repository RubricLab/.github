## :fast_forward: Quick Start

### Monorepo: [`/rubric`](https://github.com/RubricLab/rubric)
Our monorepo `/rubric` houses our [website](https://rubriclab.com) and internal tools, serving as a hub for our digital assets.

### Boilerplate Initialization :computer:
Kickstart your project with our CLI tool, inspired by `create-next-app` / `create-t3-app`, packed with a Rubric-flavored, highly opinionated boilerplate to get you up and running with essentials like ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js 13.5 right out of the box:
```bash
bunx create-rubric-app@latest --template fullstack
```
